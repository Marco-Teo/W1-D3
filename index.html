            <h3>Make the schiacciata</h3>
            <p>
              Perfect as an appetizer and to share with friends. What is it?
              It’s schiacciata! Shall we start? In a bowl, I combine the flours:
              Manitoba flour and all-purpose flour. I dust my hands with flour,
              take the yeast, and crumble it in like this. I start pouring in
              cold water, leaving some aside, and begin kneading. I add the
              remaining water and keep kneading. Then, I add some olive oil and
              honey, and now I knead by hand. Finally, I add the salt. Remember,
              always add the salt at the end so it doesn’t come into direct
              contact with the yeast. I transfer the dough into a greased bowl.
              The greased bowl will help the dough rise more easily. Why is
              that? Because the dough will slide along the edges. Now I cover
              the dough with plastic wrap and place it in the oven with the
              light on for about an hour to an hour and a half, until it doubles
              in size. First, I wet the countertop and my hands. This helps
              prevent the dough from sticking to either the counter or my hands.
              Now, I perform the folds three times to strengthen the dough.
              After the final round of folds, let the dough rest one last time
              for another 30 minutes. Spread the dough on a baking tray. Make
              the classic dimples. Now, add a bit more water and oil. Remember,
              in Tuscany, schiacciata is nicely oily and also quite salty. Bake
              it at 230°C (445°F) for 7 minutes. Then, lower the oven
              temperature to 190°C (375°F) and bake for 9 minutes, always in
              static mode. Finally, the last step—the sweet finish—remove the
              schiacciata, place it on a cooling rack, and return it to the oven
              at 190°C (375°F) for another 9 minutes.
